// Coverage ratchet: fail CI when a change lowers line coverage below the
// committed baseline, and make it easy to raise the bar when coverage improves.
//
// Why line coverage only: line totals are the trustworthy, stable number to
// gate on. Per-file branch/function data still lives in the HTML/lcov report
// for humans, but the aggregate rollup is gated on lines to avoid flapping the
// bar on unrelated changes.
//
//   npm run coverage          # run tests under c8, write coverage/ reports
//   npm run coverage:check    # compare against baseline, fail on regression
//   npm run coverage:update   # raise the baseline to the current coverage
